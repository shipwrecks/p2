##Description

A simple utility for generating xkcd style passwords.

##Demo

I am submitting a Jing.

##Details for teaching team

No outside code was used.  
If nothing is selected, if 0 is selected, if more than the max is selected,
or if alphabet letters is selected then the default message is "Please submit a valid number of words."
I hardcoded my array of words, so duplicated words are possible.  I used GET instead of POST just so that I easily see what I had been using in my selection to get the password.
